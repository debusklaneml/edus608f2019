#Review Topic #1: Measurement 
- <i> Variable </i> - A characteristic that can vary in value among subjects in a sample or a population.
## Types of Variables:
- <i> Categorical </i> (commonly qualitative)

- <i> Continuous </i> (commonly 'quantitative' or interval-ratio)

Different variable types typically align with different statistical tests
---

#Categorical Variables
##Examples:

Racial-ethnic groups (e.g. white, black, Hispanic)

Political Parties

Happy or sad

Gender

Major
---
#Continuous Variables - Infinite values between min and max

##Examples:

Time

Age

Income (is this really a 'discrete' variable?)
---


#Scales of Measurement 
For categorical variables, two types:
- <i> Nominal scale</i> - Unordered categories

  - Race, Gender, Major
  
  - yes vs. no

- <i> Ordinal scale </i> - ordered categories

  - Political ideology (very liberal, liberal, moderate, conservative, very conservative)
  - Levels of anxiety (high, medium, low)
  - Happiness (high, medium, low)
